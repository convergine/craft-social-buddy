Social Buddy is a CraftCMS plugin designed to streamline your social media publishing process. Effortlessly share your Craft entries as posts across multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Telegram, Medium, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter), directly from your Craft CMS (manual or automatic).

The plugin has three licensing levels depending on social media platforms supported:

- **LITE**: Facebook 
- **STANDARD**: LITE + Instagram, X(Twitter) 
- **PRO**: STANDARD + Pinterest, LinkedIn, Medium, Telegram

The plugin offers flexibility with two operating modes:

- **Automatic Mode**: Automatically publishes entries when their status changes to "Published" from a pending state.
- **Manual Mode**: Allows administrators to manually publish entries by clicking a "Publish" button, giving you precise control over what gets shared.

Before publishing, administrators need to connect the plugin to their social media accounts in the Settings section.

To enable automatic publishing, set up a cron job using the following command:

```bash
php craft element-status-events/scheduled
```

This ensures that your content is shared promptly and efficiently without manual intervention.
